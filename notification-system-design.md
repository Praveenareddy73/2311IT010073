 Notification System Design

# Stage 1

## Introduction

The Campus Notification System is designed to deliver important announcements to authenticated users in a secure and reliable manner. Notifications may include placement drives, examination schedules, event announcements, academic updates, and other campus-related information. The service follows RESTful API principles and exchanges data in JSON format to ensure seamless integration with frontend applications.

# Core Actions

The notification platform should support the following operations:

- Create a notification
- Retrieve all notifications for a user
- Retrieve a specific notification
- Update an existing notification
- Delete a notification
- Mark a notification as read
- Mark all notifications as read
- Retrieve unread notifications

# Notification JSON Schema

```json
{
  "id": 101,
  "title": "Placement Drive",
  "message": "TCS recruitment drive on Friday.",
  "type": "PLACEMENT",
  "priority": "HIGH",
  "recipientId": 55,
  "isRead": false,
  "createdAt": "2026-07-01T09:30:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-07-01T09:45:00Z"
}
```

# Real-Time Notification Mechanism

The application uses **WebSocket** to deliver notifications instantly without requiring the user to refresh the page.

### Workflow

1. User logs into the application.
2. Authentication is completed using JWT.
3. The client establishes a WebSocket connection.
4. An administrator creates a notification.
5. The notification is stored in the database.
6. The notification service publishes the event.
7. The WebSocket server pushes the notification to all eligible connected users.
8. The frontend immediately displays the new notification.


# Conclusion

The proposed REST API provides a consistent interface for managing notifications in the Campus Notification System. The design follows REST principles, uses meaningful endpoint naming, standard HTTP methods, JWT-based authentication, JSON payloads, and WebSocket-based real-time delivery. This design offers a solid foundation for future implementation in Spring Boot while providing frontend developers with a clear API contract.
